"""
In a file called professor.py, implement a program that:

* Prompts the user for a level, 
  - If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
  - Each level represent a 0-9, 10-99 or 100-999 integers.

* Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with 
 digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
* Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. 
    - If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem.
    - If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
* The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.

Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a level and returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:
